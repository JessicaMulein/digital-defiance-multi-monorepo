Immediately halts a raspberry pi that is booted with the halt image in place

Generated by ChatGPT4

To create a minimal custom image that boots the Raspberry Pi and runs the ARM64 assembly halt code, you'll need to follow these steps:

  * Create the necessary files:
  * Create a directory for your custom image:
    ```arduino
    mkdir custom-image
    cd custom-image
    ```

Create a file named halt.s and paste the ARM64 assembly halt code mentioned in the previous answer.

  * Assemble and link the code:
  ```csharp
  aarch64-linux-gnu-as halt.s -o halt.o
  aarch64-linux-gnu-ld halt.o -o halt --entry=_start
  ```

  * Create a custom bootloader configuration file:
    Create a file named config.txt in the custom-image directory with the following content:
    ```makefile
    kernel_old=1
    arm_64bit=1
    enable_uart=1
    ```

  * Create the disk image:
    ```bash
    dd if=/dev/zero of=halt.img bs=1M count=20
    ```
  * Format the image with a FAT32 filesystem:
    ```arduino
    sudo apt-get install dosfstools
    sudo mkfs.vfat halt.img
    ```
  * Mount the image and copy the necessary files:
    ```bash
    mkdir mnt
    sudo mount -o loop halt.img mnt
    sudo cp config.txt mnt/
    sudo cp halt mnt/kernel8.img
    sudo umount mnt
    ```

  * Flash the image onto a microSD card:
    * Use a tool like balenaEtcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the halt.img file onto a microSD card.

  * Boot the Raspberry Pi with the microSD card:
  * Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on. It will boot and execute the halt code immediately, which will halt the processor.

# WARNING
NOTE: This minimal custom image is created for demonstration purposes only. It does not include any standard Raspberry Pi OS features or utilities. The Raspberry Pi will become unresponsive after executing the halt code, and you may need to power cycle the device to reboot it.
